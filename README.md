#[Introduction to Signal Processing](http://siva82kb.github.io/intro_to_signal_processing/)


This is a course that provides an introduction to signal processing ideas, focusing on a detailed study of digitial signal processing (DSP), along with a preliminary introduction to ideas in adaptive signal processing. At the end of this course, we would like a student to leave with a good theoretical understanding on DSP, practical experience in implementing DSP algorithm in digital signal processors, and an intuitive understanding on Weiner and Kalman filters.

This course would be suitable for any student who has had a course on 'signals and systems' and basic probability theory.
